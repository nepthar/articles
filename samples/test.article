title: This is the title. Fun eh
author: Jordan Parker


Title 1

  If you haven't listened already, I highly recommend checking out Dan Carlin's
  Hardcore History podcast. Dan frequently reminds his listeners that he's not a
  historian, which is fantastic because it gives him some liberty to speculate
  about what people living in the past may have been thinking or feeling.

  Hardcore History has been on my mind often lately, partly beacuse I'm closer to some of the places where these historical events have taken place and partly because Dan often talks about how he struggles to pick an appropate starting point when he wants to begin a new topic. I find myself spending a good chunk of time answering the "where to begin" question, so much so that actually beginning has been significantly delayed.





Title 2

  // This is a comment. Cool, eh?
  This is another paragraph. Interspersed here are going to be some block quotes but first I Need to fill up this line with a lot of nonsense.

    Here's a blockquote. Isn't it nice.
    It might melt, so put it on ice.




  Very well formatted of it, don't you think. How touching!

Title 3

  The titling.

  This paragraph doesn't really jive with the rest.
  I think it should be interestped as a really really long title. Also notwe
  the lack of two lines earlier

    footnote:
    Did you know? people are terrible


    footnote:
    This should be a separate footnote

  No space at the end here!
  // Just a comment at the end again.

Title 4. An ecxceptionally long title that does something
sepcial. I guess

  Neato. Here's a code example:

    code: c++
    int main(...) {
      // This is a C++ comment.
      // It should not be stripped from the document here
      return 0;
    }

  Notice that in the above, we have a C++ comment.
  // This comment shouldn't be rendered in the final article
  We don't want that C++ comment to vanish
