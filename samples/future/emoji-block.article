  Sometimes, you have a little introduction paragraph, but then you want to call visual attention to something. The way to do this in an article is by a notice block. Here's a few examples below.

    attn:
    This is just a default attention. It renders in some kind of stand out way.

    attn: warning
    A bit more visually standoutish, perhaps in some bright color.

    attn: :shrug:
    This will render a notice with the "shrug" emoji.

    attn: üí£
    This is a regular notice that will render an icon of a bomb.

    attn: danger ‚ö†Ô∏è
    An attention block rendered in the "danger" theme/color with that emoji as
    the symbol

    attn: danger :warning:
    An attention block rendered in "danger" theme with the same emoji as above, except it's using the emoji substitution thingy.

  There ya go.
