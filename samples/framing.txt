I'm not sure what this will be.




Section 1 - Live and Let Die.

  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmo incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Elit pellentesque habitant morbis tristique senectus et netus et. Felis bibendum ut tristique et egestas quis ipsum suspendisse. Mi proin sed libero enim sed faucibus turpis in. Commodo nulla facilisi nullam vehicula ipsum a arcu cursus vitae. Facilisi etiam dignissim diam quis enim. Venenatis tellus in metus vulputate eu scelerisque felis imperdiet.
  That was all one long paragraph. This will be globbed up into it as well.

  This is a separate paragraph.

Section 1.1

  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. whatever.

    This is a second ending quote. We must make sure it does not
    gobble up the two lines separating this from
    the start of Section 2.


Section 2 - Live and Let Diet

  Somthing

    The default blockquote. Just indented, no hints as to what it is.
    A poem
      A song
        The default.
    These linebreaks should be preserved along with
      the indents.

    This is not a new section. It's part of the previous block

    This, however, is is a new quote block. It's separated from the previous
    blockquote by that little period up there to the left.

  Something else


Section 3 - A multiple line section:
Wow, here's the second line of the title.

  Introduction to this blockquote tests.

    - It's got some bullet points

    - That's cool, I guess.

    quote: argument
    This is a "block" (as opposed to a paragraph) which has a hint to
    the parser about what type it is. The parser will try to find
    something that is registered to handle "hint1" types of blocks.

    quote: argument, argument2
    This is a second quote which could be confusing to separate from the
    first. If you're a computer, that is. We must handle this
    gracefully.

  Another paragraph now continues. But finally, here's a block to end
  this section

    hint3: arg3
    This
      is
        a
      weird
    block
    .

The End.
